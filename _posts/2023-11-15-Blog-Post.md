title: Simple Real-Time Chat-App using Socket Programming in Python!
---

Using the socket application, I will be making a basic real-time chat application for our Event Driven Programming activity. Basically, messages are sent over a network using sockets and the socket API.

# Server-side 
---

## 1. Let's first import Libraries.

```
import socket
import threading
```

## 2. Let's configure the server next.

```
HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 55555
```
While the **PORT** will be the server port number, the **HOST** defines the IP address.

## 3. Now, let's create a Socket.
```
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
```
This socket is designated as IPv4 by **AF_INET** and as a TCP socket for handling streams of data by **SOCK_STREAM**.

## 4. Let's now use the ***bind()*** and ***listen()*** functions.
```
server_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))
server_socket.listen()
```
The server begins listening for incoming connections after binding the socket to a particular address and port.

## 5. List for storing clients
```
clients = []
```
In order for the server to be able to monitor the number of clients attempting to connect.

## 6. With the exception of the client that sent the message, this function informs all connected clients of the message.
```
def broadcast(message, client_socket):
    for client in clients:
        if client != client_socket:
            try:
                client.send(message)
            except:
                clients.remove(client)
```

## 7. This function distributes messages from a particular client to all other clients while it is continuously listening for new ones.
```
def handle_client(client_socket):
    while True:
        try:
            message = client_socket.recv(1024)
            if not message:
                clients.remove(client_socket)
                break
            broadcast(message, client_socket)
        except:
            clients.remove(client_socket)
            break
```

## 8.  Acceping Clients
```
while True:
    client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
    clients.append(client_socket)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket,))
    thread.start()
```
In order for the server to continue operating while it waits for more clients to connect, we will create a **while loop**. It acknowledges and ***adds a new client*** to the list whenever one connects.

### In its simplest form, the server is the one that watches out for users. A new thread is started to handle the messages from a connected client, and the client is added to the list. Every message sent by a client is continuously monitored by the server, which then broadcasts it to all other clients that are connected.

# Client-side 
---

## 1. Let's first import Libraries.
```
import socket
import threading
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import scrolledtext, END, simpledialog
```
- **socket**: creating and managing sockets
- **threading**: this module allows us to run multiple threads at the same time
- **tkinter**: we will be needing this so that we can create a GUI for the app
- **scrolledtext**: it is a widget so that we can scroll the text area
- **simpledialog**: we can use this to create a dialog for inputs such as username

## 2. Let's configure the client next.
```
HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 55555
```
While the **PORT** will be the client port number, the **HOST** defines the IP address. Same with the server.

## 3. Simpledialog to get client's username
```
username = simpledialog.askstring("Username", "Enter your username:", parent=tk.Tk())
```
It will display a dialog box with the simpledialog_asktring so that the client can enter any username they choose.

## 4. Creating socket and connecting it to the server
```
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect((HOST, PORT))
```
- **socket.socket**: to create new sockets
- **socket.AF_INET**: to know that this belong to IPV4 address
- **socket.SOCK_STREAM**: so that we can identify what type of socket it is, it is a TCP socket.
- **connect((HOST, PORT))**: to basically set up the connection to the server

## 5. Defining functions
```
def send_message(event=None):  # Modified to accept an event argument
    message = entry.get()
    if message:
        full_message = f"{username}: {message}"
        client_socket.send(full_message.encode())
        entry.delete(0, END)

def receive_messages():
    while True:
        try:
            # Receive message from the server
            message = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
            # Display the message in the chat area
            chat_area.config(state=tk.NORMAL)
            chat_area.insert(tk.END, message + '\n')
            chat_area.config(state=tk.DISABLED)
            chat_area.yview(tk.END)
        except:
            break
```
The ***receive_messages*** function is in charge of continuously receiving and displaying messages from the server, while the ***send_message*** function is in charge of sending messages from the client to the server.

## 6. Designing using the tkinter library
```
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Chat with friends!")

root.geometry("400x500")
root.resizable(width=False, height=False)

root.iconbitmap(default='Python\chat.ico')
```
The main graphical window's design, which comprises the window's size, title, and personalized icon, is contained in these sections of the code. As you can see, in order for you to create it, we must utilize the tkinter library in order to use its GUI design tool.

```
chat_area = scrolledtext.ScrolledText(root, state=tk.DISABLED, wrap=tk.WORD, height=20, width=50, font=("Helvetica", 12))
chat_area.pack(padx=10, pady=10)

entry = tk.Entry(root, width=40, font=("Helvetica", 12))
entry.pack(pady=10, padx=10)

send_button = tk.Button(root, text="Send", command=send_message, font=("Helvetica", 12), bg="#4CAF50", fg="white")
send_button.pack(pady=10)
```
The code for the message entry, chat display, and send button widgets is located in this section. The send button, message entry field, and chat area are all designed using the Tkinter library. 

```
root.configure(bg="#B0A695")  # Set background color
```
Background color for the main windows of the app.

## 7. Adding key bind (coz why not)
```
root.bind('<Return>', send_message)
```
To have it send messages to the other client or user whenever the client or user presses the "Enter" key, I added a key bind <Return> to the send_message function.

## 8. Threading to receive messages
```
receive_thread = threading.Thread(target=receive_messages)
receive_thread.start()
```
To ensure that it is always listening for messages from the server, create a separate thread.

### To put it shortly, this code creates a connection between a client and a server for a chat application. It uses tkinter to generate a graphical interface, has message sending and receiving features, and initiates a thread to maintain message receiving.
