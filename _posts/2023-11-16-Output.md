You must execute the server.py (server-side) twice or more times in order to support two or more users. 
You must also execute the client.py (client-side) at the same time. I ran both the server.py and the client.py twice in order 
to have two clients connected to the server, as you can see from the photo or image. The user or client can create or select the username of what they want.
